# Library of C functions
The aim of this project is to code a library in C language regrouping usual functions used in other projects. Here is the list of the full library:

>_to note, functions are progressively added in the coming week_

- `ft_atoi`: _ASCII TO Integer_, convert the string argument `str` to integer (`int` type) and return it.
- `bzero` : _Bytes set to zero_ function sets the first `n` bytes of the memory area pointed to by `s` to zero.
- `calloc` : _Contiguous Allocation_ allocates a block of memory for an array of specified elements, initializes it to zero, and returns a pointer to the first element.
- `ft_isalnum`: _Is Alphanumeric_, check if the character is alphanumeric and return `1`, if not return `0`.
- `ft_isalpha`: _Is Alphabetic_, check if the character is alphabetic and return `1`, if not return `0`.
- `isascii` : Checks if a given integer `c` represents an ASCII character and returns `1` if true, otherwise returns `0`.
- `isdigit` : Checks if a given character (represented as an integer `c`) is a decimal digit, i.e., one of the characters '0' through '9'.
- `isprint` : _Is printable_ checks if a given character is printable, including space, and returns 1 if true and 0 if false.
- `ft_itoa`: _Integer TO ASCII_, convert an integer to a string of characters.
- ~~lstadd_back~~
- ~~lstadd_front~~
- ~~lstclear~~
- ~~lstdelone~~

- ~~lstlast~~
- ~~lstmap~~
- ~~lstnew~~
- ~~lstsize~~
- ~~memchr~~
- ~~memcmp~~
- ~~memcpy~~
- ~~memmove~~
- ~~memset~~
- `ft_putchar_fd`: write the character `c` on the file descriptor `fd`.
- `ft_putendl_fd`: write the string `s` to the file descriptor `fd` and a new line.
- ~~putnbr_fd~~
- ~~putstr_fd~~
- ~~split~~
- ~~strchr~~
- ~~strdup~~
- ~~striteri~~
- ~~strlcat~~
- ~~strlcpy~~
- ~~strlen~~
- ~~strmapi~~
- ~~strncmp~~
- ~~strnstr~~
- ~~strrchr~~
- ~~strtrim~~
- ~~substr~~
- `ft_tolower`: if the character passed in argument is a capital letter, convert it to lowercase.
- `ft_toupper`: if the character passed in argument is a lowercase letter, convert it to uppercase.
